# dbt + Snowflake + Airflow Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive data engineering pipeline, integrating dbt (Data Build Tool) for data transformation, Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse, and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration. It provides a structured and scalable solution for data ingestion, transformation, and scheduling.

## Key Features

-   **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers the entire data lifecycle from raw data ingestion to transformed, analysis-ready datasets.
-   **Declarative Transformations with dbt:** Utilizes dbt for version-controlled, modular, and testable data transformations within Snowflake.
-   **Cloud Data Warehousing with Snowflake:** Leverages Snowflake's scalable and performant architecture for data storage and processing.
-   **Automated Orchestration with Airflow:** Schedules and monitors data pipelines using Apache Airflow, ensuring timely and reliable data delivery.
-   **Scalable and Maintainable:** Designed for easy extension and maintenance, accommodating growing data volumes and evolving business requirements.

## Technologies Used

-   **dbt (Data Build Tool):** For defining and executing data transformations.
-   **Snowflake:** Cloud-based data warehouse.
-   **Apache Airflow:** Workflow management platform for scheduling and monitoring pipelines.
-   **Python:** For scripting and Airflow DAGs.
-   **SQL:** For data querying and dbt models.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project, you will need:

1.  **Snowflake Account:** Access to a Snowflake instance with appropriate permissions.
2.  **dbt CLI:** Installed and configured to connect to your Snowflake instance.
3.  **Apache Airflow Environment:** A running Airflow instance (local, Docker, or managed service).
4.  **Python Environment:** With necessary libraries (e.g., `apache-airflow`, `dbt-snowflake`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Snowflake Configuration:**
    *   Create a dedicated database, schema, and warehouse in Snowflake for this project.
    *   Ensure your Snowflake user has the necessary permissions (e.g., `CREATE SCHEMA`, `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`).

2.  **dbt Project Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the `dbt` directory within the cloned repository.
    *   Configure your `profiles.yml` file to connect dbt to your Snowflake instance. An example `profiles.yml` might look like:
        ```yaml
        your_project_name:
          target: dev
          outputs:
            dev:
              type: snowflake
              account: <your_snowflake_account>
              user: <your_snowflake_user>
              password: <your_snowflake_password>
              role: <your_snowflake_role>
              database: <your_snowflake_database>
              warehouse: <your_snowflake_warehouse>
              schema: <your_snowflake_schema>
              threads: 4
              client_session_keep_alive: False
        ```
    *   Run `dbt debug` to verify your connection.
    *   Run `dbt seed` to load any seed data.
    *   Run `dbt run` to execute your dbt models and create transformed tables in Snowflake.

3.  **Airflow DAGs Deployment:**
    *   Place the Airflow DAG files (e.g., `dags/your_pipeline_dag.py`) into your Airflow `dags` folder.
    *   Ensure all necessary Airflow connections (e.g., Snowflake connection) are configured in the Airflow UI.
    *   Install any required Python packages for your DAGs (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-snowflake`, `dbt-common`) in your Airflow environment.

## Pipeline Flow

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Raw data is ingested into Snowflake (e.g., via Snowpipe, external stages, or direct loading).
2.  **dbt Transformations:** Airflow triggers dbt commands (`dbt run`, `dbt test`) to transform raw data into curated datasets within Snowflake.
3.  **Data Consumption:** Transformed data in Snowflake is ready for consumption by BI tools, analytics platforms, or other applications.

## Usage

-   **Monitor with Airflow:** Use the Airflow UI to monitor the status of your data pipelines, view logs, and manage task dependencies.
-   **Explore Data in Snowflake:** Query the transformed tables in Snowflake using SQL to gain insights.
-   **Develop with dbt:** Extend or modify data transformations by adding new dbt models, tests, and documentation.
